Description: Pool of asyncio coroutines with familiar interface
 AioPool makes sure no more and no less (if possible) than size spawned
 coroutines are active at the same time. spawned means created and
 scheduled with one of the pool interface methods, active means coroutine
 function started executing it's code, as opposed to waiting -- which
 waits for pool space without entering coroutine function.
